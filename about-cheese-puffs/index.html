			<h2>History</h2>
		
			<p>When dancer, musician, and journalist Molly Freedenberg used to take long solo road trips, she would often listen to music by Richard Cheese and his band, Lounge Against the Machine. Delighted by the inherent humor of covering rock, rap, and pop songs in a lounge style, and inspired by the band’s virtuosic and theatrical arrangements, she found herself imagining full-scale theatrical productions to accompany each song.</p>
			
			<p>The band’s slow, moody version of xxx’s “Relax?” Clearly that would be a smoky, blue-lit, melodramatic lyrical dance solo, like she’d seen in her middle school dance recitals. The Latin-flavored cover of U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday?” That was a red-lit salsa trio with big layered flamenco skirts and Spanish fans. And the big band cover of Guns n Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle?” Obviously that was a show-stopping Broadway number performed by a hundred girls in matching costumes weaving patterns on a staircase set, like a cross between a Busby Berkeley film and a Vegas show finale.</p>

			<p>This production was called “Richard Cheese, the Musical” and the dancing girls were called “The Cheese Puffs” in her head. And that’s where they lived until she moved to San Francisco and met Adrian Roberts.</p>

			<p>Adrian co-founded Bootie SF, which not only featured clever DJed mash-ups, but a midnight theatrical performance, and often a live mash-up band complete with Adrian as frontman. When Molly attended Bootie, she sensed that its creator appreciated the same combination of humor, musical virtuosity, and spectacle that she did. So when she met Adrian at an EDF fundraiser, as a way of bonding, she told him about her idea for the musical.</p>

			<p>They did bond. But more importantly, Adrian hired The Cheese Puffs on the spot. They would perform the midnight show at a Bootie party less than two months away.</p>

			<p>The only problem? The Cheese Puffs didn’t exist yet.</p>
